# React Three Fiber Product Viewer Demo

This project is a 3D product viewer built with [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and Vite. It showcases an interactive 3D object with orbit controls, hover interactions, and accompanying product information. The goal is to demonstrate how WebGL and modern front-end tools can enhance digital product experiences, particularly in e-commerce or technical product catalogs.

## Features

- 🎛️ Real-time 3D model rendering with React Three Fiber
- 🌀 Orbit controls for smooth rotation and zoom
- 🖱️ Hover interaction effects
- 🧱 Custom textures applied to cube surfaces
- 💬 Product information overlay with title, price, and description
- ⚡️ Fast development setup with Vite
